# Introduction

Primefy allows you to efficiently implement the best payment solution for your business with just a few lines of code.

The purpose of Primefy's API is to enable payment transactions made with Credit Cards, Boleto BancÃ¡rio (Bank Bills) and PIX, whether single or recurring. You will also be able to manage payment transactions through capture, cancellation or refund, in addition to being able to include subscription plans for your products and services.

## API Reference

The Primefy API is developed using a [RESTful](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/REST) framework. It has predictable resource-oriented URLs, accepts [form-encoded request bodies](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/POST), returns [JSON-encoded responses](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/JSON), and uses standard HTTP response codes.

### **Endpoint**

```json
https://api.premepay.com/v1
```

## Test Mode

The Primefy API is also available in a test environment - `Staging`. This means that during the setup process until the official integration launch, active data from our clients' platforms is not affected, and there is no real interaction with their banking networks. All of this is done to ensure the security of the integration procedure and high levels of performance and accuracy after its launch.
