# HTTP Status Codes and Payment Errors

Primefy uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate whether an HTTP request has been successfully completed. The responses are grouped into five classes.

## Response Classes

| Class                      | Response |
| --------------------------- | -------- |
| Informational Responses     | 1xx      |
| Success Responses           | 2xx      |
| Redirection                 | 3xx      |
| Client Error Responses      | 4xx      |
| Server Error Responses      | 5xx      |

## HTTP Status Table

| Status | Message             | What does it mean? |
| ------ | ------------------- | ------------------ |
| 200    | Ok                  | This request was successful. The meaning of success varies depending on the HTTP method used. |
| 201    | Created             | The request was successful, and a new resource was created as a result. |
| 401    | Unauthorized        | Client without permission or not authenticated. |
| 403    | Forbidden           | The client does not have access rights to the content, so the server is rejecting the request. |
| 404    | Not found           | HTTP response that indicates the client was able to communicate with the server, but the server could not find what was requested. |
| 422    | Unprocessable Entity| The request is well-formed but unable to be followed due to semantic errors. |
| 500    | Internal Server Error | The server encountered a situation it doesn't know how to handle. |
