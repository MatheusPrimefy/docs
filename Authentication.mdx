To start the integration process with the Primefy API, the first step is to perform the authentication procedure. This is the step that enables you to connect with the services offered by Primefy.

[**POST - Authentication**](https://www.notion.so/POST-Authentication-0e00c292d14f4e2dbacacb11238fd4e6?pvs=21)

To go through this step, you first need to request the authorization token. To do this, the API uses the user's credentials, such as username and password. The information is sent in the request body, and after being processed by the server, it will return a status and a [JSON](https://www.json.org/json-en.html) object as a response.

The response varies depending on the [HTTP status code](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status). **If the request is successful, you will receive a response with a status code of 200**. Additionally, the returned object will provide the username, the token that will be used in subsequent API requests, and an expiration date for that token.

Always valuing security, we recommend that you whitelist or allowlist the domains `api.premepay.com` and `premeapi-staging.premepay.com` in your servers.

>ğŸš§ **The Authentication Token expires after 60 minutes.** After this period, it is necessary to authenticate again.
