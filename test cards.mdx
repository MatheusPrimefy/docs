## What are test cards?

Test cards are fictional credit cards. These cards are primarily used by development professionals to simulate, validate, and confirm the proper functioning of checkout processes and other types of online payment environments.

This page includes test card numbers and other information to ensure that your integration works correctly. We recommend creating different scenarios during your testing phase to guarantee good results in various situations.

‚ö†Ô∏è Please do not use test card numbers in a production environment. These cards are valid only in the test environment.
